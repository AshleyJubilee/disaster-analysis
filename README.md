# disaster-analysis
SCS BootCamp Project 1

For this project we analyzed data from the EM-DAT, an international disaster database distrubuted by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) for non-commercial use.

Each group member has done their own individual analysis on a specific axis. Ashley on Human Development Index, Daniel on Spatial Distribution, Jessamyn on Year over Year, and Shileola on Disaster Type. 

The most important factor for disaster severity is the HDI status of the impacted country. Low HDI countries are much more severely affected by disasters than high HDI countries.

The other axis of analysis show specific regional breakdowns of what the most severe disasters are, where they happen and when they occur.
